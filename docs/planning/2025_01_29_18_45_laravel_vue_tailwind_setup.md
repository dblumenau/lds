# Laravel + Vue + Tailwind Project Setup Planning

## Task Description
Set up a new Laravel project called "Learn Danish Swiftly" (LDS) with:
- Laravel as the backend framework
- Tailwind CSS as the styling framework
- Vue.js as the frontend framework
- Following Laravel best practices

## Project Details
- **Project Name**: Learn Danish Swiftly (LDS)
- **Location**: ~/Sites/LDS
- **Type**: Full-stack web application

## Clarification Questions

### 1. Laravel Version & Requirements
- Should I use the latest Laravel version (12x)? - Yes
- Do you have any specific PHP version requirements? - PHP 8.2 or higher
- Will this use Laravel Sail for Docker development or native PHP/MySQL? - No we are using laravel valet, its all set up already.

### 2. Vue.js Integration Approach
- **Option A**: Laravel Breeze with Vue scaffolding (includes authentication)
- **Option B**: Laravel with Inertia.js + Vue (SPA-like experience with server-side routing)
- **Option C**: Separate Vue SPA with Laravel API backend -
- **Option D**: Traditional Laravel with Vue components sprinkled in - This one!

Which approach aligns best with your project goals?

### 3. Authentication & Starter Kit
- Do you need authentication scaffolding? - Yes
- If yes, which starter kit:
  - Laravel Breeze (simpler, includes Vue option) - This one.
  - Laravel Jetstream (more features, teams, 2FA, etc.)
  - Custom authentication implementation

### 4. Database & Environment
- Database preference: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite?
- Will you be using your standard local development environment?
- Do you need any specific environment configuration?

### 5. Additional Package Requirements
- Do you need any specific Laravel packages installed from the start?
- Any Vue.js specific libraries (Vue Router, Pinia/Vuex, etc.)?
- API requirements (REST, GraphQL, etc.)?

### 6. Development Workflow
- Should I set up hot module replacement for Vue development?
- Do you want TypeScript support for Vue components?
- Any specific linting or code style preferences?

## Proposed Approach (pending clarifications)

Based on common best practices, here's my initial recommendation:

1. **Laravel Installation**
   - Use latest stable Laravel (12.x)
   - Install via Composer

2. **Frontend Stack**
   - Laravel Breeze with Vue.js option (provides good starting point)
   - Tailwind CSS (included with Breeze)
   - Vite for asset bundling (Laravel default)

3. **Development Environment**
   - Assume standard local PHP/MySQL setup
   - Configure .env for local development

4. **Initial Structure**
   - Set up basic authentication scaffolding
   - Configure Vue components structure
   - Set up Tailwind with proper purging

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Laravel application successfully installed and running
- [ ] Vue.js integrated and working with hot reload
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured and working
- [ ] Basic authentication scaffolding (if needed)
- [ ] Development environment properly configured
- [ ] Can access application in browser
- [ ] Vue components can be created and rendered
- [ ] Tailwind styles properly compiled

## Potential Considerations
- Context7 integration for Laravel best practices lookup
- Browser testing setup with browsermcp
- Database migrations structure
- API structure if building SPA
- Testing framework setup (PHPUnit, Jest/Vitest)

## Next Steps
Once you've reviewed and answered the clarification questions above, I'll proceed with the implementation following the agreed approach.
