# Match Madness Game Development Specification

## Game Overview
Match Madness is a fast-paced word-matching game where players connect word pairs (typically translations) under time pressure. The core mechanic involves dragging or tapping to connect matching pairs from two columns of words. - just tapping!

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Basic Setup
The game presents two columns of words on screen. The left column contains words in one language (or category), and the right column contains their corresponding matches in another language (or related terms). Players must connect the correct pairs by drawing lines or tapping between matching words. - just tapping

### Matching Interface
Players can connect words using two primary methods: drag-and-drop where they click and drag from one word to its match, or tap-to-select where they tap one word then tap its corresponding match. Visual feedback shows active selections with highlights or color changes, and completed matches display connecting lines or visual indicators. - again, only tap one word and then tap its match

### Scoring System
Points are awarded based on speed and accuracy. Correct matches earn base points, with bonus multipliers for consecutive correct matches or completing matches quickly. The scoring typically includes a time bonus that decreases as seconds pass, streak bonuses for multiple correct matches in a row, and perfect round bonuses for completing all matches without errors. - lets not fuss over points yet, just focus on correct matches

### Time Pressure Elements
Each round has a countdown timer, usually ranging from 30-90 seconds depending on difficulty. The timer creates urgency and adds pressure to make quick decisions. Some variations include bonus time awarded for correct matches or time penalties for incorrect attempts. - lets just use a 60 second timer for now

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### User Interface Components
The game needs two scrollable columns that can accommodate varying numbers of word pairs. Each word should be contained in a tappable/draggable element with clear visual boundaries. The interface requires a prominent timer display, score counter, and progress indicator showing completed matches. - always 5 pairs of words, once a match is made the word should fade out and a new one replaces it with a new fade (until there are no more matches)

### Visual Feedback System
Implement hover states for desktop or touch highlights for mobile devices. Show clear visual connections between matched pairs using lines, color coding, or animation effects. Incorrect matches should display brief error animations or color flashes. Completed matches can fade out, change color, or show checkmark indicators. - no hover, we are just tapping

### Animation and Polish
Add smooth transitions for connecting lines, satisfying particle effects or celebratory animations for correct matches, and screen shake or error animations for mistakes. The timer should have visual urgency indicators as time runs low, such as color changes or pulsing effects. -

### Audio Design
Include sound effects for correct matches, incorrect attempts, timer warnings, and completion celebrations. Background music should build tension without being distracting, with the option for players to adjust or mute audio. - no audio for now, we can add it later

## Game Progression and Difficulty

### Difficulty Scaling
Start with fewer word pairs (5-6) and gradually increase to 8-12 pairs per round. - no just 5 pairs

### Round Structure
Each game consists of multiple rounds with increasing difficulty. Players advance by completing rounds within the time limit with a minimum accuracy threshold - no multiple routnds, just one round with 5 pairs of words to start, as matches are made new matches replace them until there are no more matches -  we will have a total of 30 matches.

## Platform Considerations

### Mobile Optimization
Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for finger taps, implement smooth drag-and-drop mechanics that work well on touchscreens, and optimize layouts for both portrait and landscape orientations. Consider haptic feedback for tactile responses on mobile devices. - no, just tap to select a word and then tap its match no haptic or whatever else

### Responsive Design
We are only really targeting bigger phones so we only care about 425px.

### Performance Requirements
Maintain smooth 60fps gameplay with responsive touch/click detection. Minimize loading times between rounds and ensure animations don't impact game responsiveness. The game should handle varying word lengths. - i dont think you can even do fps in a web game right?


This specification provides a comprehensive foundation for developing a Match Madness-style game while leaving room for creative interpretation and platform-specific optimizations.
